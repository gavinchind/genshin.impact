    <h1>The Genshin Info Page</h1>
      <p> Rather than reading my endless tangent, you decide to come here instead. This place is taken seriously in contrast to the main page where I rant about the injustice Genshin brings with it.
      <p> Here you'll find some tips (good ones, I don't know.) and tricks along with information regarding things like possible loot drops from domains.
      <p> Hopefully it'll be of some use. (to me or anyone who views this...)
