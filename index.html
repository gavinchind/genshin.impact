        <h1>Genshin Impact... in a nutshell</h1>
            <img src="genshin.jpeg" alt="genshin" height="100%">
                <p>Genshin Impact, a truly wonderous but unforgiving world. At face value it is an open world rpg where you collect fun characters you can take into battle whilst collecting new treasures and furthering your power. This however is all a facade to the underlying truth to Genshin Impact... A cashgrab gacha system where you'll lose all your lifesavings guranteed (jk).

        <h1>Part 1... Gacha Gaming</h1>
            <p>When you are thrust into the unforgiving world that is Genshin Impact, you'll be presented with Amber (the most garbage unit /j) and the Traveler, the protagonist of this isekai. As you progress through the game and battle a literal dragon to save the city of Mondstadt, you meet some side characters. After engaging in a heated conversation (not), you'll eventually get your first items to "wish" in this game, the games' gacha system. The term "wish" perfectly describes it as you'll be wishing for a refund and your life back when you either spend hundreds of dollars or hours grinding primogems to get the character you want in a limited time frame. As excitement gathers in your veins, you press the multi (x10) button in the wishing menu, 
                <ol>
                    <li style="color:DodgerBlue;">Slingshot</li>
                    <li style="color:#9305e6;">Noelle</li>
                    <li style="color:#9305e6;">Noelle</li>
                    <li style="color:#9305e6;">The Flute</li>
                    <li style="color:#9305e6;">Noelle</li>
                    <li style="color:#9305e6;">Noelle</li>
                    <li style="color:#9305e6;">Noelle</li>
                    <li style="color:DodgerBlue;">Debate Club</li>
                    <li style="color:DodgerBlue;">Slingshot</li>
                    <li style="color:#9305e6;">Noelle</li>
               </ol>
            <p>only to be presented with The Flute and a C6 Noelle.
            <p> Basically, you waste away your existence to gain pixels. How exhilarating.

        <h1>Part 2... Mondstadt: The Land of Freedom... and Shackles</h1>
            <p>As you eventually whisk away your delusions of getting the featured 5 star and your favorite characters, you decide to run your Traveler with a C0 Bennett and your C6 Noelle. Life looks fun and you gather materials for the first time, make an unperfected piece of trash food and set off on your adventure. You stab some level 3 slimes after quite a while and feast upon the 3 Mora (the currency of Genshin) you earned through slaughtering their peaceful lives. You then go on to farm more slimes, just to buy salt from the NPC back at Mondstadt to cook some steak or something. All the while you progress through the game, you start to go through the <i>MEAT</i> of the game, and progress through the <b>MAIN QUEST</b>. You're truly enveloped in the vast world of Teyvat and now you're immersed in the game. Hours upon Hours you find yourself playing the game and you start to lose track of time, minutes become hours, hours into days, days into months... And what have you gained? Mora...? Salt...? What is there left for you...

        <h1>Part 3... Hilichurl III: Revenge of the Hilichurl, Attack on Traveler</h1>
            <p>Oh boy, now that your Dull Blade is level 20, and your <i>Characters</i> having been ascended, you start to battle your way through the multitude of monsters that exist in the game. You dash, dodge, and using your <b>ELEMENTAL SKILL</b> to absolutely eviscerate the opposing parties. You are having fun! As you roam around the lands in search of your next target... you find the elusive H I L I C H U R L. Yes, the Hilichurl. A peaceful race to be quite frank. They live in their little villages and have a diverse culture. Peaceful beings for sure. But you, you say no. The thought of having that 5 Mora entices you and you are set off into a rage. A berserk state that people refer to as "grinding"... After only a matter of seconds, you come back with the masks of the fallen Hilichurls and you use them as a catalyst to power up your characters. The Hilichurl tribe, having enough of this decides that if you evolve and get stronger, they'll have to also evolve to keep up with your seemingly endless potential...

    <hr>
        <h1>Part 4... Adventure Rank: How long have you been playing?</h1>
            <p>As you get stronger, your enemies will also increase in difficulty as well. You wouldn't want to be beating up ants as a firebreathing salamander right? So, the monsters naturally grow in strength as you progess. The average Hilichurl can go from a limp, lanky man, to an absolute chad capable of destroying lands. It's all part of the fun though!!! All you get to do is Rank Up so you can fight more diverse and harder mobs. Only downside is you have to grind for quite a while. Maybe a few months or so... no I mean days, yes days thats right. You're not wasting your life on this game I can assure you.

        <h1> Part 5... Gacha 2: Empty Wallet</h1>
            <p>As you continually progress, you start to become tired of running your Noelle. You go to the wishing menu and see that you have around 4800 Primos, and you think to yourself that maybe you can splurge a little and obtain a new character, thus beginning a new gambling addiction. Sweat accumulates on your palms and your fingers inch closer and closer to the x10 Multi-Wish button and finally after a lifetimes worth of contemplating you go all in. The star like objects race by your screen as it flashes a color different than blue... Is it Gold? No, its a purple you dimwit. Now you have your long awaited C10 Noelle!!! But no, that C10 Noelle is not enough... you want more. You whip out your credit card in a swift fashion and quickly purchase tens of thousands of Genesis Crystals. Why do you bother spending your precious hard earned money on pixelated possessions? I don't know and neither do you. So, now you set off in the journey to get the featured character. Your pity is at around 40, and now you've set your sights on the newest released character. You do one multi, you get a 4 star Lion's Roar. Another, and you get a Sacrificial Greatsword. Your pity.. at 60. You quickly gaze at your Genesis Crystal count, and it has already diminished by a fifth of its original amount. Its only been minutes, and you comtemplate wishing for more, quite literally. However, you give in and another 3200 Primos goes down into the infinite abyss and you realize, you're 10 wishes away from reaching your pity. Excitement rushes through every fiber of your being as you press the multi button, and it flashes gold. Then you get a................ Qiqi.

        <h1>Part 6... Liyue: Just Sold my Soul to the God of Contracts</h1>
            <p>Now that you have finally finished the main storyline of Mondstadt, you feel relieved! A very miniscule amount of lifespan has been used to complete the storyline for Mondstadt and now you're ready to set off on your own adventure. That is, until you learn that Mondstadt was only one of 7 regions... Now on the Traveler's journey, you end up going into the land where the element of Geo reigns. Liyue, the next region you'll be staying in worships the Archon (a god basically) of Geo, Morax. You make your way into a strange but wonderous new world brimming with wildlife that is native to this distant land. You see a statue and start to get flashbacks. Flashbacks that you had long ago locked away in the deepest depths of your mind vault. Those painful memories resurface upon seeing a slight deviation from the statues in Mondstadt. Yes, it's time to roam around the world again to get +8 Stamina each time you whisk away hours of your life. After a little moment of invoked trauma, you finally decide to ignore it and you take a stroll around. A lot of delicacies reside within Liyue that differ from the goods found in Mondstadt and you gain a new reason to keep playing. After a long while, you roam around until you find a city next to the seemingly endless stretch of water. That now, is where your story begins in Liyue. One that is controlled by the God of Contracts, Morax. One where you sold your soul... to Liyue.

        <h1> Part 7... Domains & Gacha Glore: Advent of RNG </h1>
            <p>The enemies start triumphing in battle at an alarming rate but you have no clue why! Your characters are maxed out in level, and your weapons have been nurtured and refined for what seemed like centuries to you. You however, take a look within your character artifact set up and discover that you're still using +0 common artifacts... You've been destroying your own potential! With this, you take up arms and travel to the nearest domain. What awaits beyond that door is something frightening however. It's a beast that no mortal could ever hope to tame within any meager timespan. It's alias, RNG. No slime, hilichurl, dragon, or some primordial rock monster could ever hope to measure up with the insurmountable power that RNG posesses. It has the power to quickly demolish any foolish people that dare measure up it, and you are one of those who stand before it. Walking into a death trap where you know demise is imminent is tough, however the glory that awaits behind said RNG is enough to send you deep into the gruelling game of reality. DEF%, HP% mainstats, DEF, HP, DEF%, HP% substats, all riddling your loot pools with its tainted genes. You could build a whole Hu Tao or Albedo with those or even Noelle with these artifacts but no. You want to play with your traveler and just wanted to give them a good artifact set with decent crit damage and rate paired alongside a healthy supplement of ATK%/ATK. But no, reality is tough. Within the reaches of defeat, you are stirred with a sense of determination. This bad RNG can't bring you down, and you decide to figure out your fate with another gacha session. The primogems you've been saving up for around 2 months at the ready, and you descend into the wishing menu. The featured character stares you into the eye and you know that today is the day you defy destiny to finally obtain a featured character from a banner. You summon 10x. 20x, 30x, 40x, 50x, 60x, 70x, 80x... Where is your pity? What seemed like an eternity passed by as you realize you've been stuck in this endless loop while your hard earnings burned away like ashes in the wind. You finally realize that there is no redemption. Only pain and RNG.
